      <h3>History of Crocheting</h3>
      <p>Crochet has been traced back to the 15th-17th century and is believed to have originated from Arabia. However, this has not been confirmed as many cultures have crochet in thier history. While very much similar to knitting, the difference is the number of hooks being used and the technique. Crocheting allows for a more creative method, as many people are able to crochet clothes, stuffed animals, house decor, and much more.</p>
