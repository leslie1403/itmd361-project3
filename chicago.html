      <h3>History of Chicago</h3>
      <p>Chicago was proclaimed a city in 1837 when it population reached a total of 4,000 people. It has many historic elements and stories, such as the Great Chicago Fire. It developed near the river where it meets the lake due to the many benefits the lake provides. From this, the city developed into the third largest city.</p>

      <p>One of my favorite things to do when I go downtown is take pictures. I love taking pictures and trying different angles to capture the same thing from different perspectives, and making it look completely different. Below is one of the pictures I took when I went on a helicopter ride.</p>
